# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-and-Analysis-Using-Deep-Learning-Models
# Introduction
•	This study focuses on predicting and analyzing Bitcoin prices using deep learning models, specifically GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).

•	Deep learning models have gained popularity in financial forecasting due to their ability to capture complex patterns and dependencies in time-series data.

•	The goal is to leverage the power of GRU and LSTM to accurately predict Bitcoin prices, considering the volatile and non-linear nature of cryptocurrency markets.

•	The study will compare the performance of GRU and LSTM models in terms of their predictive accuracy and provide insights into their strengths and weaknesses.
# Problem  Statement 
•	The problem statement for this study is to develop and evaluate deep learning models, specifically GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), for predicting and analyzing Bitcoin prices.

•	The volatility and non-linear nature of cryptocurrency markets pose a significant challenge for accurate price prediction, making it an important problem to address.

•	The goal is to leverage the capabilities of GRU and LSTM models, known for their ability to capture long-term dependencies and handle sequential data, to forecast Bitcoin prices with high accuracy.

•	The study aims to explore the performance of these deep learning models in capturing the complex patterns and dynamics present in Bitcoin price data, providing valuable insights into their effectiveness for cryptocurrency price prediction.

•	The analysis will involve training the GRU and LSTM models on historical Bitcoin price data, considering various input features such as previous price values, trading volumes, and technical indicators.

•	The performance of the models will be evaluated based on metrics like accuracy, mean squared error, and root mean squared error.

•	By comparing the performance of GRU and LSTM models, the study will identify which model performs better in terms of predicting Bitcoin prices accurately and analyze the reasons behind their performance differences.
# Methodology
•	The methodology involves collecting historical Bitcoin price data along with relevant features.

•	The data is preprocessed, which includes handling missing values, scaling, and feature engineering.

•	The dataset is divided into training and testing sets.

•	GRU and LSTM models are implemented and trained on the training set.

•	The models are then evaluated on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics.

•	Comparative analysis is conducted to assess the performance of the GRU and LSTM models in Bitcoin price prediction.
